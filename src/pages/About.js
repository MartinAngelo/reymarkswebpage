                <h2>Philippines Weather & Climate</h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>The Philippines have a tropical maritime climate, meaning the weather is generally hot and quite humid. The region really only experiences three seasons, a hot dry summer between March and May known as tag-init, a wet season between June and November known as tag-ulan and a coller dry season between December and February known as tag-lamig. The Philippines weather patterns are created by the prevailing winds of the southwest monsoon (known as the habagat) from May to October and the northeast monsoon (known as the amihan) from November to early May.</p>
                <br></br> <p>Average temperatures in the Philippines usually range between 21 °C (70 °F) and 32 °C (90 °F) with the average yearly temperature coming in at around 26.6 °C (79.9 °F). Temperatures can fluctuate between regions and depending on the season, however generally January is the coolest month while May is the warmest. The Philippines are also affected by typhoons, also known as bagyo, which occur between June and November. Really only affecting the Visayas, Cebu is the only tourist destination that is impacted by these conditions however, typhoons can result in significant damage in these areas or heavy rain across the rest of the country.</p>
                <br></br> <p>Aside from typhoon season when the weather can be wet and unpredictable, there really is no bad time to visit the Philippines. The best time to visit the Philippines weather-wise is from January to May however unsurprisingly this is also the peak tourist season. There are plenty of beautiful places to escape in the Philippines where you won't have to compete with tourist crowds if you don't want to however if you don't mind a little rain during your stay, the low season from June to September is a good time to visit as it is considered the 'rainy' season, although some areas don't experience rain during this time This is a good option is you are looking to save money or visit when things are less busy</p>
